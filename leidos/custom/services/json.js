         "notes": "<p>DMA Performance Measurement Application Overview Prototype Version 1.0 ============================<\/p>\r\n<p>The purpose of the prototype DMA Performance Measurement application is to measures mode-independent trip-based traveler mobility and system productivity by taking trip or trajectory based vehicle input and aggregating that information into system wide performance measures. The DMA Performance Measurement application uses trip-based system performance measure algorithms developed under the Integrated Corridor Management (ICM) Program and adapts them for use with observed data to measure travel time reliability, delay,and throughput.<\/p>\r\n<p>License information -------------------<\/p>\r\n<p>Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.

See the License for the specific language governing permissions and limitations under the License.<\/p>\r\n<p>System Requirements -------------------------<\/p>\r\n<p>The DMA performance measurement application software can run on most standard Window or Linux based computers with Pentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space. Performance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in the system. Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the amount of data being read into the software.<\/p>\r\n<p>The DMA performance measurement application was developed using the open source programming language Python 2.7 (www.python.org). The application requires Python 2.7 or higher to run. Note that Python 3.0 is a change from Python 2.X language and will not run the DMA performance measurement application. Python versions 2.7.X – 2.9.X will work.<\/p>\r\n<p>The application can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems. Python is installed by default on many Linux and Mac operating systems.<\/p>",

Information defines those objects necessary for real time positioning; Logging provides facilities for outputting debugging and information messages to the file system or screen; Messaging provides an Alert object which can route a message or event from a user to another; Orders defines the objects that are necessary to instantiate an order to process through the optimization algorithm, such as drivers, jobs, jobs status updates, and which actions are available to undertake during a stop; Planning segregates thoseelements uses to set up and generate an optimization plan for a number of drivers with some number of jobs; Times supplies an access point for fine tuning actions by the day of th week; and Users defines the objects necessary for user management.<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.Infrastructure - Project Infrastructure, Ninject Inversion of Control (IoC)<br />Infrastructure segregates the Infrastructure; Infrastructure.Data; Infrastructure.Engine; and Infrastructure.Threading objects that are used to implement the Dependency Injection pattern and support multi-threaded generation of the optimal route.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Services <br />PAI.FRATIS.DataServices - Services for Domain Objects, Persistence<br />Provides an access point for application access of persistence repositories during execution of the optimization algorithm.<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.DataServices.Core - Entity Services base implementations<br />Instantiates low level objects and services used by the PAI.FRATIS.DataServices.Core objects to manage cache and repository access.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />External Services <br />PAI.FRATIS.Services.ExternalDistanceService - Navteq implementation of pluggable external traffic / distance service<br />Provides an access point, plug-in framework for interfacing with external data sources.<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.Wrappers.NokiaMaps - Nokia Here / Maps external service implementation<br />An example implementation of the Nokia Mapping Service<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.Wrappers.QueueTimes - Acyclica external service implementation for Terminal Queue reporting<br />An example implementation of an external Terminal Queue Reporting Service<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.Wrappers.WebFleet - TomTom WEBFLEET external service implementation<br />An example implementation of the TomTom Mapping<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.Wrappers.YahooWeather - Yahoo Weather external service implementation<br />An example implementation of the Yahoo Weather Service<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.YusenTerminalService - Yusen Marine Terminal external service implementation<br />An example implementation of the Yusen Terminal Service<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Optimization Algorithm <br />PAI.Drayage.Optimization - Optimization Algorithm<br />The optimization algorithm, wherein jobs and drivers are matched on user provided selection criteria. Typically this is minimizes either time or distance traveled while servicing as many jobs as possible.<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.Optimization.Adapter - “Adapter” intermediary between domain objects and algorithm<br />Access point for further configuration and adjustment of the optimization algorithm or supporting object after initialization and during run-time.<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.Drayage.Optimization.Reporting - Reporting and statistical service for optimization algorithm solutions<br />A collection of objects and methods that will examine generated routes and schedules to extract meaningful data over the generated route solutions.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Executable Processes <br />PAI.FRATIS.BackgroundProcesses - Background process wrappers for container availability, traffic/travel time<br />Supplimental process that run in worker threads supporting the creation and maintenance of relatively static and parallelizable data sources and elements<\/p>\r\n<p>PAI.FRATIS.ConsoleDemo - Demo application <br />A simple console application that demonstrates how to provide data to and consume the results of the optimization algorithm. Uses a random subset of a static data set to create drivers and orders to feed into the algorithm. Additionally illustrates how to consume the results of the optimizer.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Tests <br />PAI.Drayage.Tests Test base classes and Extension methods<br />PAI.FRATIS.ExternalServices.Tests Integration tests for external data source connections<br />PAI.FRATIS.Tests Unit tests to ensure the correct behavior of the component objects of the project whole.<\/p>\r\n<p>==========================================================================================================================<\/p>\r\n<p>The Drayage Optimizer will produce a solution set that represents the best determined sequence of stops, minimizing the total time for execution based upon Locations, Divers, Jobs, Routes, Traffic Delays, and Queue Delays provided to the algorithm. Traffic delays can be provided by any third party external system that estimates travel times considering traffic within two locations. Queue delays can be provided by any third party external system that estimates waiting times to get into a location (for example, the case of waiting in queues at the gates of Marine Terminals) <br />The solution is built leveraging v4.5 of the .NET Framework. The optimization class library has a small footprint, and should run successfully on any computer capable of supporting .NET v4.5.<\/p>",

For the traveler, T-DISP provides an ability to access real-time information about available travel options, including costs and predicted time, in order to best manage their commute. For an agency, T-DISP extends demand / response services to support dynamic routing and scheduling, and even add/remove vehicles from service, based on traffic conditions, vehicle capacity, ridership and origin-destination, among other factors.<br />D-RIDE takes the concept of traditional pre-planned ridesharing (i.e., carpooling) and brings it into the 21st century. It does this by leveraging the positioning, messaging, and computing capabilities of today’s smartphones, and advancing an application that will let drivers and travelers, in near real-time, exchange information about needs or in case of a driver, available space.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Hardware Supported:<br />Cloud Based Services: Microsoft Azure<br />IDTO MDT: Android 4.0+<br />IDTO Mobile Applications (Connect and Ride): iOS 7.0+ and Android 4.0+<\/p>\r\n<p>Installation Instructions:<br />There is no installer included with this package.

Only Source code is provided.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Description of the project:<br />There are two primary capabilities of the INFLO system; Dynamic Speed Harmonization (SPD-HARM)<br />and Queue Warning (Q-WARN). Detailed descriptions of both can be found in the INFLO Concept<br />Development and Needs Identification and the Report on Detailed Requirements for the INFLO<br />Prototype documents. Below are brief descriptions of each application.<br />Speed Harmonization<br />Speed harmonization of traffic flows in response to downstream congestion, incidents, and weather or<br />road conditions can greatly help to maximize traffic throughput and reduce crashes. Research and<br />experimental evidence have consistently demonstrated that by that reducing speed variability among<br />vehicles, especially in near-onset flow breakdown conditions, traffic throughput is improved, flow<br />breakdown formation is delayed or even eliminated, and collisions and severity of collisions are<br />reduced.<br />The INFLO SPD-HARM application concept aims to realize these benefits by utilizing connected<br />vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to detect the precipitating<br />roadway or congestion conditions that might necessitate speed harmonization, to generate the<br />appropriate response plans and speed recommendation strategies for upstream traffic, and to<br />broadcast such recommendations to the affected vehicles.<br />Queue Warning<br />Queuing conditions present significant safety concerns, particularly with the increased potential for<br />rear-end collisions. They also present disruptions to traffic throughput by introducing shockwaves into<br />the upstream traffic flow. The INFLO Q-WARN application concept aims to minimize the occurrence<br />and impact of traffic queues by utilizing connected vehicle technologies, including V2I and V2V<br />communications, to enable vehicles within the queue event to automatically broadcast their queued<br />status information (e.g., rapid deceleration, disabled status, lane location) to nearby upstream vehicles<br />and to infrastructure-based central entities (such as the TMC) in order to minimize or prevent rear-end<br />or other secondary collisions.<\/p>",

Only Source code is provided.<\/p>\r\n<p><br />Description of the project:<br />R.E.S.C.U.M.E contains two prototype Connected Vehicle (CV) applications under the U.S. Department of Transportation (U.S. DOT) Dynamic Mobility Applications (DMA) Program. <br />The R.E.S.C.U.M.E. project incorporates prototype development and demonstration of Response Staging (RESP-STG) and Incident Zone (INC-ZONE) applications using integrated <br />technologies that mutually support each other and comprise an integrated R.E.S.C.U.M.E. bundle that is a key research activity within the DMA program.<br />The RESP-STG application provides situational awareness to and coordination among emergency responders―upon dispatch and while en-route― to establish incident <br />scene work zones both upon initial arrival and staging of assets, and afterward, if circumstances require, additional dispatch and staging. It provides valuable input to responder <br />and dispatcher decisions and actions. A range of data will be provided through mobile devices and other types of communication to help support emergency responder vehicle routing, <br />staging, and secondary dispatch decision-making. The INC-ZONE application improves protection of personnel at incident sites from the threat of oncoming vehicles, particularly <br />where those vehicles are being operated outside of recommended speed, and lane guidance where there have been crashes, incidents, or other events impacting traffic such as stalled <br />vehicles or vehicles pulled over for moving violations. The INC-ZONE application includes an in-vehicle messaging system that provides oncoming drivers with merging and speed guidance <br />around an incident. The INC-ZONE application also provides in-vehicle alerts and warnings to drivers in violation of speed and lane closure restrictions, both for the protection of the <br />drivers and incident zone personnel. Finally, the INC-ZONE application includes a warning system for on-scene workers when a vehicle approaching or in the incident zone is being <br />operated outside of safe parameters for the conditions.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>The Trajectory Conversion Algorithm (TCA) Software is designed to test different strategies for producing, transmitting, and storing Connected Vehicle information. The TCA reads in and uses vehicle trajectory information or VISSIM output, Roadside Equipment (RSE) location information, cellular or event region information, and strategy information to produce a series of snapshots that the vehicle would produce. Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit Probe Data Messages (PDMs) and/or Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) which can be transmitted by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and/or via cellular. The TCA program version 2 Build 2 or 2.2 assumes perfect communication between vehicles and RSEs but future versions of the TCA 2 will include simulated communication disruptions. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly without any loss of information. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency.<\/p>\r\n<p>License information<br />-------------------<br />Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this<br />file except in compliance with the License.<br />You may obtain a copy of the License at <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0<\/a><br />Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under<br />the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY<br />KIND, either express or implied.

      "description": "<p>The Trajectory Converter Analysis-PARAMICS (TCA-P) Software is designed to test different strategies for producing, transmitting, and storing Connected Vehicle information. The TCA-P runs with the PARAMICS tool using real-time simulation vehicle information, Roadside Equipment (RSE) location information, cellular or event region information, and strategy information to produce a series of snapshots that the vehicle would produce. Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit Probe Data Messages (PDMs) and/or Basic Safety Messages (BSMs) which can be transmitted by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and/or via cellular. The TCA program version 2 Build 2 or 2.2 assumes perfect communication between vehicles and RSEs but future versions of the TCA 2 will include simulated communication disruptions. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download all of its snapshot information directly without any loss of information. Similarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot information directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and latency.<\/p>\r\n<p>License information<br />-------------------<br />Licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this<br />file except in compliance with the License.<br />You may obtain a copy of the License at <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\">http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0<\/a><br />Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under<br />the License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY<br />KIND, either express or implied.

The IFTWG was seeking a solution to congestion, ineffectiveness, and increasing energy consumption that stemmed from the inefficiency of cross-town “rubber tire” interchanges (i.e., traffic from truck to rail, and rail to truck to rail) by developing and deploying an information sharing capability that enables the coordination of moves between parties to maximize loaded moves and minimize unproductive moves. In 2012, US DOT funded a project focusing on the Real-Time Traffic Monitoring and Dynamic Route Guidance components of C-TIP by incorporating optimization heuristics and a robust routing algorithm. The team selected by the US DOT partnered with a drayage company in Memphis, TN to be the basis for developing and deploying the optimization algorithm and other related technology.<\/span><\/pre>\r\n<pre style=\"overflow: auto; font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap; color: #333333;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">\r\nApproach--To effectively handle the complexity of the drayage problem inherent in the Memphis C-TIP and ensure that the algorithm is working properly:<\/span><\/pre>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #333333;\">The development and validation of the algorithm was divided into multiple iterations<\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #333333;\">The algorithm performance was tested over a set of different problems ranging from well-known benchmark problems to specially customized ones <\/span><\/li>\r\n<li><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt; color: #333333;\">The performance assessment of the algorithm relied on sets of real data that were collected from the daily operations of the drayage company in Memphis, TN over six-month period <\/span><\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n<pre style=\"overflow: auto; font-family: Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', Menlo, Courier, monospace; font-size: 15px; margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; line-height: normal; white-space: pre-wrap; color: #333333;\"><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;\">To improve the capabilities of the optimization algorithm and to increase the robustness of its generated plans, data collection and testing was separated into two phases: one three-month Pre-Deployment Phase and one three-month Post-Deployment Phase. Each phase ensured that the algorithm design, development, and deployment were effective. Pre-Deployment and Post-Deployment phase issues were thoroughly examined, documenting all findings and response actions on a continual basis in order to minimize any impact to the project schedule, maintain user adherence to processes, and avoid similar issues in the future.\r\nDescription and objectives--The main objective of C-TIP project was the development, testing, and deployment of an Algorithm that utilizes powerful and intelligent optimization heuristics to improve drayage operations while considering all operational constraints and restrictions associated with drayage moves. The main concern of the project was to maximize the loaded moves and minimize the unproductive ones, which improves drayage companies’ efficiency, reduces congestion on the roads, and impacts the environment by decreasing carbon footprint.\r\nDue to the complexity of the drayage problem, the proposed optimization algorithm was developed through multiple iterations. In each iteration, the performance of the algorithm was validated and tested to ensure that the algorithm was working properly. The algorithm performance has been tested over a set of different problems ranging from well-known benchmark problems to specially customized ones.   \r\n\r\nRelease notes--The Drayage Optimizer will produce a solution set that represents the best determined sequence of stops, minimizing the total time for execution based upon Locations, Divers, Jobs and Routes provided to the algorithm.\r\nThe solution is built leveraging v4.5 of the .NET Framework.

      "description": "<p>The LA-Gateway FRATIS demonstration project is focused on:<br /> Improving communications and sharing intermodal logistics information between the truck drayage industry and port terminals such that terminals are less congested during peak hours;<br /> Improving traveler information available to intermodal truck drayage fleets so that they can more effectively plan around traffic and port congestion; and<br /> Employment of an optimization algorithm which will allow for the technologies to work together in a way which optimizes the drayage fleet deliveries and movements based on several key constraints (e.g., time of day, PIERPASS restrictions, terminal queue status, etc.).<\/p>\r\n<hr id=\"system-readmore\" />\r\n<p><br />Together, these three areas of focus can result in significant improvements in intermodal efficiency, including reductions in truck trips, reductions in travel times, and improved terminal gate and processing efficiency. These benefits, in turn, will directly result in the public-sector benefits of congestion reduction an improved air quality.<br />The two primary private-sector participants in the FRATIS LA demonstration project are Yusen Terminals, Inc. (Port of LA Terminal) and Port Logistics Group (regional drayage fleets of 50 trucks). The primary regional public-sector agencies that are supporting the test are LA Metro, The Gateway Cities Council of Governments, and the Port of LA.<\/p>\r\n<p>The optimization algorithm used in this project is an extension on the algorithm used in the Cross Town Improvement Project (C-TIP) Drayage Optimization Proof of Concept Application. Due to the complexity of the drayage problem, the proposed optimization algorithm was developed through multiple iterations. In each iteration, the performance of the algorithm was validated and tested to ensure that the algorithm was working properly. The algorithm performance has been tested over a set of different problems ranging from well-known benchmark problems to specially customized ones.<\/p>\r\n<p>Release notes--The Drayage Optimizer will produce a solution set that represents the best determined sequence of stops, minimizing the total time for execution based upon Locations, Divers, Jobs, Routes, Traffic Delays, and Queue Delays provided to the algorithm. Traffic delays can be provided by any third party external system that estimates travel times considering traffic within two locations. Queue delays can be provided by any third party external system that estimates waiting times to get into a location (for example, the case of waiting in queues at the gates of Marine Terminals) <br />The solution is built leveraging v4.5 of the .NET Framework. The optimization class library has a small footprint, and should run successfully on any computer capable of supporting .NET v4.5.<\/p>",

Different response rates were tested in the simulation model with the implicit assumption that the connected vehicle combined response rate used in the simulation model runs is the market penetration rate depreciated for communication loss, and driver compliance effects. Three different response rates were tested in the simulation model, 50%, 25%, and 10% of the total passenger-vehicle fleet. Six possible scenarios combining three possible traffic demand levels, three possible severity levels of incidents and two possible weather types for the corridor were evaluated for each response rate.

See the License for the specific language governing\r\npermissions and limitations under the License.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------------\r\nThe TCA-P 2.0 software can run on most standard Window or Linux based computers with \r\nPentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.\r\nPerformance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in \r\nthe system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the \r\namount of data being read into the software.\r\n\r\nThe TCA 2.0 software application was developed using the open source\r\nprogramming language Python 2.7 (www.python.org).  The application requires Python 2.7\r\nor higher to run.  Note that Python 3.0 is a change from Python 2.X language and will not\r\nrun the DMA performance measurement application.  Python versions 2.7.X – 2.9.X will work.\r\n\r\nThe application can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems.  Python is installed\r\nby default on many Linux and Mac operating systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe TCA-P 2.0 software is packaged with Word based User Guide\r\n\"The Trajectory Convertor Algorithm-PARAMICS 2 3 User manual.doc\" that contains all information about background\r\npurpose, benefits, objectives, inputs/outputs, how to run the software and requirements for the software.\r\n\r\nWeb sites\r\n---------\r\nThe TCA-P 2.3 software is distributed through the USDOT's JPO\r\nOpen Source Application Development Portal (OSADP)\r\n\r\nhttp://itsforge.net/ <\/pre>",

      "description": "<p> <\/p>\r\n<pre>TCA-V 2.3 Overview\r\n============================\r\nThe Trajectory Conversion Algorithm-VISSIM (TCA-V) Software is designed to test different strategies \r\nfor producing, transmitting, and storing Connected Vehicle information. The TCA-V runs with the VISSIM \r\ntool using real-time simulation vehicle information, roadside equipment (RSE) location information, \r\ncellular or event region information and strategy information to produce a series of snapshots that a \r\nconnected vehicle would produce. Vehicles can be equipped to generate and transmit Probe Data Messages \r\n(PDMs), Basic Safety Messages (BSMs), Cooperative Awareness Messages (CAMs) or ITS SPOT messages which \r\ncan be transmitted by Dedicated Short Range Communication (DSRC) and/or via cellular. The TCA-V program \r\nversion 2 build 3 or 2.3 includes simulated communication disruptions between vehicles and roadside \r\nequipment. As soon as a vehicle equipped to transmit via DSRC is in range of a RSE, it will download \r\nall of its snapshot information directly with a probabilistic uncertainty of the data being lost. \r\nSimilarly, if the vehicle is equipped to transmit via cellular, it will download all its snapshot \r\ninformation directly but those snapshots might be lost or delayed due to user-defined loss rate and \r\nlatency. In TCA-V 2.3, BSMs and PDMs can also be made to transmit at user-defined intervals.\r\n\r\nLicense information\r\n-------------------\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this\r\nfile except in compliance with the License.\r\nYou may obtain a copy of the License at http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\r\nUnless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, software distributed under\r\nthe License is distributed on an \"AS IS\" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY\r\nKIND, either express or implied. See the License for the specific language governing\r\npermissions and limitations under the License.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------------\r\nThe TCA-V 2.0 software can run on most standard Window or Linux based computers with \r\nPentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.\r\nPerformance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in \r\nthe system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the \r\namount of data being read into the software.\r\n\r\nThe TCA 2.0 software application was developed using the open source\r\nprogramming language Python 2.7 (www.python.org).  The application requires Python 2.7\r\nor higher to run.  Note that Python 3.0 is a change from Python 2.X language and will not\r\nrun the DMA performance measurement application.  Python versions 2.7.X – 2.9.X will work.\r\n\r\nThe application can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems.  Python is installed\r\nby default on many Linux and Mac operating systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe TCA-V 2.0 software is packaged with Word based User Guide\r\n\"The Trajectory Convertor Algorithm-VISSIM 2 3 User manual.doc\" that contains all information about background\r\npurpose, benefits, objectives, inputs/outputs, how to run the software and requirements for the software.\r\n\r\nWeb sites\r\n---------\r\nThe TCA-V 2.0 software is distributed through the USDOT's JPO\r\nOpen Source Application Development Portal (OSADP)\r\n\r\nhttp://itsforge.net/ <\/pre>",

The AOP was one application within the prototype system. The AOP requires 2 Excel or comma separate input file containing 30 columns; these input files were generated from Southwest Freight’s dispatching software [vendor: Trinium Technologies]. One file contains loaded orders, and the second file contained empty orders, but both files contained the same column structure. A blank template is included within the uploaded zip file. The user must select the input file from any location on their desktop. To account for Southwest Freight requirements, the program limits the number of orders that can be assigned to a single driver (route) to four, although this can be altered in the code. In addition, the program offers the user the flexibility to determine the number of drivers/routes that should be included in the daily plan. For Southwest Freight, they wanted to make sure a certain number of drivers would have work each day. This can also reduce the number of orders per route/driver. As described above, both the user interface and code were written in Java. There is no installer included with this package. Only Source code is provided.<\/p>",

      "description": "<p>Description of the project:<br />There are two primary capabilities of the INFLO system; Dynamic Speed Harmonization (SPD-HARM) and Queue Warning (Q-WARN). Detailed descriptions of both can be found in the INFLO Concept Development and Needs Identification and the Report on Detailed Requirements for the INFLO Prototype documents. Below are brief descriptions of each application.<\/p>\r\n<p>Speed Harmonization<br />Speed harmonization of traffic flows in response to downstream congestion, incidents, and weather or road conditions can greatly help to maximize traffic throughput and reduce crashes. Research and experimental evidence have consistently demonstrated that by that reducing speed variability among vehicles, especially in near-onset flow breakdown conditions, traffic throughput is improved, flow breakdown formation is delayed or even eliminated, and collisions and severity of collisions arereduced.<\/p>\r\n<p>The INFLO SPD-HARM application concept aims to realize these benefits by utilizing connected vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication to detect the precipitating roadway or congestion conditions that might necessitate speed harmonization, to generate the appropriate response plans and speed recommendation strategies for upstream traffic, and to broadcast such recommendations to the affected vehicles.<\/p>\r\n<p>Queue Warning<br />Queuing conditions present significant safety concerns, particularly with the increased potential for rear-end collisions. They also present disruptions to traffic throughput by introducing shockwaves into the upstream traffic flow. The INFLO Q-WARN application concept aims to minimize the occurrence and impact of traffic queues by utilizing connected vehicle technologies, including V2I and V2V communications, to enable vehicles within the queue event to automatically broadcast their queued status information (e.g., rapid deceleration, disabled status, lane location) to nearby upstream vehicles and to infrastructure-based central entities (such as the TMC) in order to minimize or prevent rear-end or other secondary collisions.<\/p>",

The R.E.S.C.U.M.E. project incorporates prototype development and demonstration of Response Staging (RESP-STG) and Incident Zone (INC-ZONE) applications using integrated technologies that mutually support each other and comprise an integrated R.E.S.C.U.M.E. bundle that is a key research activity within the DMA program.<\/p>\r\n<p>The RESP-STG application provides situational awareness to and coordination among emergency responders―upon dispatch and while en-route― to establish incident scene work zones both upon initial arrival and staging of assets, and afterward, if circumstances require, additional dispatch and staging. It provides valuable input to responder and dispatcher decisions and actions. A range of data will be provided through mobile devices and other types of communication to help support emergency responder vehicle routing, staging, and secondary dispatch decision-making.<\/p>\r\n<p>The INC-ZONE application improves protection of personnel at incident sites from the threat of oncoming vehicles, particularly where those vehicles are being operated outside of recommended speed, and lane guidance where there have been crashes, incidents, or other events impacting traffic such as stalled vehicles or vehicles pulled over for moving violations. The INC-ZONE application includes an in-vehicle messaging system that provides oncoming drivers with merging and speed guidance around an incident. The INC-ZONE application also provides in-vehicle alerts and warnings to drivers in violation of speed and lane closure restrictions, both for the protection of the drivers and incident zone personnel. Finally, the INC-ZONE application includes a warning system for on-scene workers when a vehicle approaching or in the incident zone is being operated outside of safe parameters for the conditions.<\/p>",

See the License for the specific language governing\r\npermissions and limitations under the License.\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\n-------------------------\r\nThe TCA 2.0 software can run on most standard Window or Linux based computers with \r\nPentium core processers, with at least two gigabits of RAM and at least 100 MB of drive space.\r\nPerformance of the software will be based on the computing power and available RAM in \r\nthe system.  Larger datasets can require much larger space requirements depending on the \r\namount of data being read into the software.\r\n\r\nThe TCA 2.0 software application was developed using the open source\r\nprogramming language Python 2.7 (www.python.org).  The application requires Python 2.7\r\nor higher to run.  Note that Python 3.0 is a change from Python 2.X language and will not\r\nrun the DMA performance measurement application.  Python versions 2.7.X – 2.9.X will work.\r\n\r\nThe application can be run on Windows, Linux, or Mac operating systems.  Python is installed\r\nby default on many Linux and Mac operating systems.\r\n\r\n\r\nDocumentation\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe TCA 2.0 software is packaged with Word based User Guide\r\n\"The Trajectory Convertor Algorithm 2 3 User manual.doc\" that contains all information about background\r\npurpose, benefits, objectives, inputs/outputs, how to run the software and requirements for the software.\r\n\r\nWeb sites\r\n---------\r\nThe TCA 2.0 software is distributed through the USDOT's JPO\r\nOpen Source Application Development Portal (OSADP)\r\n\r\nhttp://itsforge.net/ <\/pre>",
